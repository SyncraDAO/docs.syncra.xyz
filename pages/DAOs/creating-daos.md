# Creating DAOs

Creating a DAO is a great way to leverage the power of blockchain technology to manage a community or a project. Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to create a DAO using Syncra platform:

### 1. Connect your wallet

Before creating a DAO, you'll need to have a wallet that can connect to the blockchain. You can use polkadot{.js} wallet extension to connect to Syncra dApp.

### 2. Create DAO

Once you have connected your wallet, you can start creating your DAO.

### 3. Provide Information

You'll need to provide some basic information about your DAO, such as its name, logo, background image, and social media links. This information is used to represent your DAO on the blockchain and make it easily recognizable to other users.

### 4. Choose your strategy

There are two main strategies to choose from when creating a DAO: PSP22-based or whitelist-based. PSP22-based DAOs are based on the PSP22 standard, which allows for the creation of custom tokens that can be used to represent ownership or voting rights in the DAO. Whitelist-based DAOs, on the other hand, are based on a list of approved wallets that can participate in the DAO.

**A. Token Holders**

If you decide to go with **Token Holders** strategy, you will be asked to either provide an address of the existing PSP22 token, or create one within our UI.

**B. Addresslist**

In case of **Addresslist** voting, please provide a list of (AlephZero based) wallet addresses eligible for voting.

**NOTE:** Please be aware of the fact that selected DAO Strategy (Token Holders or Addresslist), will also impact the available Voting Strategies in the DAO.

### 5. Set up Voting Rules

Depending on the strategy you choose, you'll need to provide proposal voting rules and a list of approved wallets for your whitelist-based DAO. This information is used to ensure that only approved participants can participate in the DAO and have voting or ownership rights.

### 6. Confirm your choices and create your DAO 

Once you have provided all the necessary information, you can review your choices and confirm your decision to create your DAO. After confirming your decision, your DAO will be created and visible on the blockchain. You can now start managing your community or project through your DAO.
