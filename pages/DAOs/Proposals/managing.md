# Managing Proposals

Managing proposals within a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Syncra platform involves overseeing the proposals and making informed decisions. Key aspects of proposal management include:

* Connect and Verify: Ensure your wallet is connected and you have the necessary permissions.

* Access DAO Page: Visit the relevant DAO page from the Syncra platform.

* Review Proposals: Examine existing proposals with details like title, description, and voting results.

* Take Action: Depending on your role, you can cast vote, comment, or view voting results for each proposal.

* Monitor Progress: Keep an eye on the proposals as they progress through the voting phase.

* Implement Approved Proposals: If a proposal is approved, take the necessary steps to implement it.

Managing proposals is crucial for effective DAO governance and aligning with the community or project's objectives.
