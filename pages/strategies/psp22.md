# Token Holders Strategy

The Token Holders Strategy takes a different approach to voting within a DAO. This strategy uses a token-based system, where each PSP22 token held by a wallet represents a certain amount of voting power. Here's a closer look at this strategy:

* Token-Based Voting Power: In the Token Holders Strategy, the number of tokens held by a wallet determines its voting power. If one PSP22 token equals one vote, a wallet holding 100 PSP22 tokens wields voting power equivalent to 100.

* Ownership-Based Incentives: This strategy ties voting power to the ownership of the underlying asset (PSP22 tokens). It incentivizes token holders to act in the best interest of the organization, as their influence in the DAO is directly proportional to their token holdings.

* Customization: PSP22 tokens can be customized to represent ownership or voting rights in the DAO. This flexibility allows for creative use of tokens and innovative governance structures.

# Available Voting Strategies

* Basic Voting or Referendum

Similar to the Whitelist-based strategy, participants can vote "YES," "NO," or "ABSTAIN" on a proposal. However, in this strategy, voting power is determined by the number of PSP22 tokens held by each participant.

* Weighted Voting

In the Weighted Voting strategy, participants can vote on multiple answers, and the voting power can be split between available options. This approach allows for more nuanced decision-making, where some participants may have more influence on certain aspects of a proposal while others have greater influence on different aspects.
