#### Manager
The manager role grants the authority to modify DAO parameters. It is recommended to establish this role during the initial phases of DAO operation. Subsequently, this role can be revoked, and adjustments to DAO parameters can be made through proposals and participant voting.
In a Wallet-based DAO, it can assign new members or remove others.
