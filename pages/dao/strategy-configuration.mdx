### Choose your strategy

There are two main strategies to choose from when creating a DAO: Token-based or Wallet-based. Token-based DAOs are based on the PSP22 standard, which allows for the creation of custom tokens that can be used to represent ownership or voting rights in the DAO. Wallet-based DAOs, on the other hand, are based on a list of approved wallets that can participate in the DAO.

#### Token-based Strategy

If you decide to go with **Token-based** strategy, you will be asked to either provide an address of the existing PSP22 token, or create one within our UI.

#### Wallet-based Strategy

In case of **Wallet-based** voting, please provide a list of (AlephZero based) wallet addresses eligible for voting.

**NOTE:** Please be aware of the fact that selected DAO Strategy (Token Holders or Addresslist), will also impact the available Voting Strategies in the DAO.
