In this section, you can adjust the voting rules in your DAO.

#### Quorum
The qourum parameter tells how many votes must be cast on a proposal to validate voting.
For Token-based strategy, it is the percent of the token total supply.
For Wallet-based strategy, it is the percent of the total number of DAO members.
<Callout type="info">
Note that the calculations are performed on unsigned integer values. The final calculations result is rounded up. For example:<br/>
49% * 4 = 2<br/>
51% * 4 = 3<br/>
</Callout>

#### Proposal Threshold
Proposal Threshold is the percentage of the overall voting power (token supply or no. of members) necessary to permit the creation of a proposal by a wallet.
<Callout type="info">
Note that for Wallet-based DAOs, Proposal Threshold may require more than one voting power (each member owns exactly one voting power). In this case, only members who received enough delegations may create proposals.
</Callout>

#### Minimum and Maximum Voting Period
These parameters restrict the period of voting time which can be set by a proposal creator.

#### Voting Delay
The time gap between creating a proposal and opening it for voting.

#### Execution Delay
The minimum time interval between the conclusion of voting and the implementation of the voting resolution.
