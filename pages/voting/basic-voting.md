**Description:**

Basic Voting, also known as a Referendum, is a simple and widely used voting strategy in both Whitelist-based and PSP22-based DAOs. Participants cast their votes as "YES," "NO," or "ABSTAIN" on a proposal. Each vote carries equal weight, making it a straightforward way to gauge community sentiment and make decisions.
