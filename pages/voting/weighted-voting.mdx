  - Token-based strategy
</Callout>

Weighted Voting is exclusive to PSP22-based DAOs. In this strategy, participants can vote on multiple answers, and their voting power can be split between available options. Weighted Voting allows for more nuanced decision-making, where some participants may have more influence on certain aspects of a proposal, while others have greater influence on different aspects.
