# What is ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a written record that captures an important decision made by the team regarding the software architecture they intend to develop. It details the decision, its background, and the implications it carries. ADRs go through various stages, reflecting a lifecycle.

SYNCRA utilizes ADRs as a tool to determine the timing and scope of decisions, ensuring all essential criteria are included.
