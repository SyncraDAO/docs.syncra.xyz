# Why Syncra?

## What is Syncra?

Syncra is DAO-as-a-service platform for the Substrate network ecosystem.

We understand the importance of seamless integration and top-notch user experience, and our platform delivers exactly that. With Syncra, protocols can easily create and manage their DAOs using a single interface, eliminating the need for multiple tools and complex processes.

One of our standout features are undisclosed voting, treasury management, on-chain actions and proposal automation, making governance more efficient and effective.

## Our Mission in Building Syncra

In response to the evident need for a reliable and efficient DAO management platform within Substrate-based networks, Syncra was born. Our platform is designed as the premier solution for any entity engaged in these networks. We're dedicated to resolving numerous challenges present in existing solutions and introducing innovative features that are yet to be seen in the market.

Our primary objective is to enhance the DAO ecosystem, focusing on speed and simplicity. We aim for a system that can be set up swiftly, within minutes, offering the pinnacle of user experience in the DAO realm. Syncra allows for customizable DAO configurations, with various features crafted as modular components for straightforward integration. A pivotal feature of Syncra is our commitment to privacy, exemplified by our implementation of confidential voting mechanisms.

For these reasons, we chose Aleph Zero, a Substrate-based blockchain, as our foundational platform. This decision was influenced by the exceptional caliber of projects developed on Aleph Zero and its strong emphasis on high-quality decentralized finance. We are confident and optimistic about the potential of Aleph Zero.

## The Rationale Behind a Launch Platform, Its Timing, and Choosing Aleph Zero

In the current market downturn, one might question the timing and necessity of a launch platform. Our belief is that launch platforms are significantly underappreciated, yet they hold the potential to be key facilitators within an ecosystem. Choosing to launch in a bear market enables us to cultivate a community and develop quality projects, strategically placing us to leverage value in the forthcoming market cycle.
